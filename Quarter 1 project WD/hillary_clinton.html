	<tr> 
	<th>Issues</th>
	<th>Quotes from HC</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Abortion</td>
	<td>"Politicians have no business interfering with women's personal health decisions. I will oppose efforts to roll back women's access to reproductive health care, including Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. As president, I'll stand up for Planned Parenthood and women's access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Crime and Safety</td>
	<td>"Everyone in America should respect the law and be respected by the law. We need to end mass incarceration, use strategies like police body cameras to improve accountability, increase substance abuse treatment, and aim resources at criminals who pose the greatest threat. And we need to invest in education and job training, the foundations of success."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Economy and Jobs</td>
	<td>"We need to raise pay, create good-paying jobs, and build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. I'll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share. I'll invest in infrastructure, clean energy, and education. And I'll help parents balance work and family."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Education</td>
	<td>"As president, I'll work to ensure every child, from every ZIP code, has access to a world-class education, including access to high-quality preschool. We need to strike the right balance on testing with fewer, fairer and better tests for elementary and secondary school students. And we must support teachers with the training and resources they need."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Foreign Policy</td>
	<td>"As secretary of state, I worked to restore America's leadership in the world. As president, my top priority will be to keep us safe and defend our values. That includes maintaining a cutting-edge military, strengthening our alliances, being firm but wise with our rivals, cultivating new partners, defeating ISIS, and enforcing the Iran nuclear deal."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Healthcare</td>
	<td>"I've fought for quality, affordable health care my entire career. As president, I'll defend the Affordable Care Act, build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs. My plan will crack down on drug companies charging excessive prices, slow the growth of out-of-pocket costs, and provide a new credit to those facing high health expenses."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Gay Marriage</td>
	<td>"The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on marriage equality represents America at its best: just, fair and moving toward equality. Now we have more work to do. I'll fight to ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans have full equality under the law, and to end discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and other aspects of our society."</td>
	</tr>
	<td>Guns</td>
	<td>"More than 33,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. It's time to act. As President, I'll take on the gun lobby and fight for commonsense reforms to keep guns away from terrorists, domestic abusers, and other violent criminals including comprehensive background checks and closing loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Immigration</td>
	<td>"We need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship. If Congress won't act, I'll defend President Obama's executive actions, and I'll go even further to keep families together. I'll end family detention, close private immigrant detention centers, and help more eligible people become naturalized."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>National Security</td>
	<td>"We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out."</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>taxes</td>
	<td>"I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe."</td>
	</tr>
